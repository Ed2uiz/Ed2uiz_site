I added a lightning bolt to mine because I'm cool like that.\n\t-  `prompt::set_prompt('⚡ > ')`\n\t\t-  ![](3f6e9c4f066449faa2fa01e0752ae88b.png)\n-  [`ddotta/parquetize`](https://github.com/ddotta/parquetize)\n\t-  This R package contains handy functions to export data from a variety of sources into .parquet files! It has convenient arguments to accommodate memory limitations and other constraints that can be very useful\n\t\t-  `{arrow}` and `{duckdb}` already offer ways to do this but there are several args that `{parquetize}`  supports that these don't\n-  [`exasol` ](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lkdvwqobetjzu) database\n\t-  We did not cover this database in the workshop, but I learned about it for the first time here (even though it's been around for quite some time). \n- [ `cynkra/constructive`](https://github.com/cynkra/constructive)\n\t-  Kirilll used `constructive::construct()` to print out the contents of an R object that contained SQL. It parsed the SQL into the console nicely.  I had never heard of `dput` before this but `construct` supposedly achieves similar functionality. seems handy for objects that have a lot of SQL in it. \n-  [CORA dataset](https://relational.fel.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA)\n\t-  Public dataset in MariaDB with plenty of examples of primary and foreign keys and good 'data modeling'.\n\t-  This dataset was covered as an example of how to access a DB through R/DBI with credentials. \n-  `r\"()\"`\n\t-  Beginning with R 4.0, you can use the following syntax `r\"()\"` to construct raw string literals, this can be handy when writing SQL as alternatives to use `{glue}` (one less dependency) or `paste0()`. You don't have to escape special characters like `/` or `\\` which can be especially handy for writing file paths.\n-  ... much more that I do not have time to cover in this post. Check out the excellent lecture material at the link above.\n##  Remarks\n-  Despite covering a lot of material, this workshop was great. I thought it was well organized and informative. I learned a lot despite already knowing a bit about databases/R. Kirill included several visualizations of the concepts we were learning which made it easier to appreciate how they built on top of each other (one example shown below)!\n ![](6c0941d838484439886dd735c9b30217.png)\n-  There were several exercises that were included in the workshop that can be found on the Github repo. I thought these were quite helpful and recommend trying these out to refresh your knowledge on the many different ways to interact with databases in R. Oftentimes there are many ways to do the same thing.\n\n# DuckCon 2024\nWhen I wasn't attending posit, I was spending all of my time preparing for my lightning talk at DuckCon2024. I will write a dedicated blog post (and preprint) on this topic very soon, so stay tuned! But here are some of my quick thoughts. \n## DuckCon2024\n\n### Summary\n- Attending DuckCon was an amazing experience. The speakers were great and the venue was really impressive -- the screen was huge! After the talks, everyone was invited to gather in the venue for drinks and snacks. I was approached by several really kind people and was overwhelmed by how many were interested in my talk! I want to again thank everyone for their interest and I hope to share more on our work very soon. As a researcher, it's not always clear how wide-reaching our projects can be, it's often not the goal of our work, and there's always some level of pressure to do research that can be funded (even when there's no guarantee this will happen). So hearing that my project is of interest to others and that it could even be of use, is very encouraging.\n### Highlight\n-  Earlier in the week at the Databases workshop at Posit conf, I invited Kirill to my DuckCon talk but he mentioned that there was a conflict with a tidy thursday event and so he would not likely be able to attend. To my surprise, I found Kirill after my talk at DuckCon! We managed to find some time to chat outside and I really enjoyed being able to discuss our projects in more detail. I made sure to shower Kirill with many thanks for all of the incredible contributions he has made for R (i.e. maintaining the duckdb-r repo, creating duckplyr, and much more related to his work leading [cynkra](https://github.com/cynkra)). Thanks again Kirill for all you and your team do for R.\n\n\n![1000024662.jpg](:/c078ded7445c4d3f96c0b52599eee6ff)\n\n\n\n# Old friends, new friends, and celebrities\n## New Friends\nI've always wondered why academics enjoy attending conferences so much. After attending posit conference, I can now say with confidence that the best part is bumping into other people from other walks of life and learning about their unique background and shared interests. I was lucky to have such an experience when randomly meeting [Jeroen Huyghe](https://research.fredhutch.org/peters/en/team.html), a principal staff scientist at Fred Hutch who does some exciting research on spatial omics and cancer. Jeroen and I bonded over our shared interests in spatial omics at Posit conf and I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to have lunch with him and learn about his experiences in the spatial omics field, working at Fred Hutch, and discussing the need for better methods for spatial omics analysis. It was a pleasure meeting you Jeroen, hope we can cross paths again in the future!\n\n## Old Friends\nAt the Posit databases workshop, I had the opportunity to connect with  Nick Giangrecco, an old friend and mentor of mine from my heyday at Columbia. It was great to spend time with you Nick, learn more about our shared interests with DuckDB, and grab dinner to catch up. \n\nIt was also great to see you Tyrone Lee at both Posit and DuckCon. Thanks for your encouragment ahead of my talk. Let's grab coffee sometime when we're back in Boston!\n\n## Celebrities\n\n### Posit Conf\nIn the databases workshop, I was surrounded by several R celebrities including Eric Nantz (https://r-podcast.org/host/enantz/) and Tyler Morgan Wall (https://www.tylermw.com/), among many others! I was also lucky to have sat besides Joe Chang, Hadley Wickham, and JJ Allaire at lunch! \n### DuckCon \n- Hannes Mühleisen and Mark Raasveldt, Co-founders of DuckDB.\n\t- I was very fortunate to meet Hannes and Mark before and after the DuckCon talks. I regret not talking more about DuckDB internals with them, but I hope to meet you again soon Hannes and Mark!\n- Jordan Tigani, CEO of MotherDuck\n\t- I was lucky to have sat beside Jordan at DuckCon.  I got to pitch a few ideas to Jordan about doing matrix arithmetic with Motherduck, and hear more about the recent pivot from 'hybrid execution' to 'dual execution'. Shoutout to Frances Perry from Motherduck who gave a great talk, showcasing several new features with Motherduck that I'd like to soon try out.\n- Dominik Moritz, creator of Mosaic and Prof at CMU\n\t- Briefly met Dominik outside of the venue, huge fan of his work and hope to soon support ways to use Mosaic with dbverse objects\n- And several others... \n![1000024673.jpg](:/3f1cf2d281ec41358dcf2fd8c9cf1920)\n\n\n# Next steps\n- Road to v0.1\n\t- We released `dbMatrix` and `dbSpatial` at DuckCon2024 as 'developer previews' with much work yet to do. Below are some changes we will be working on in the coming weeks towards our first 0.1 release.\n\t- Release `dbData` \n\t\t- dbData will contain essential functions that are shared across dbverse objects. It will also handle caching connections to a database which should alleviate some of the challenges when working with multiple dbverse objects and having to refresh their database connection. \n\t\t- I'm also excited to explore inheriting `duckplyr` in dbData \n\t\t\t- Issue #86 in duckplyr was recently resolved by Kirill. Now, users can take existing `tbl_dbi` objects and convert them into the the duckplyr framework via `as_duckplyr_tibble()`  as shown below. (Note: this is not yet released as of 08/20/2024, you must load the dev version of duckplyr and duckdb-r)\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_4780cf665f5ee09470e9db8a901ab766'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n⚡ > dbsm_table\n# Source:   table<sparse_test> [?? x 3]\n# Database: DuckDB v1.0.1-dev4228 [root@Darwin 23.5.0:R 4.4.1//private/var/folders/h8/lxlpbpsx351fll0v5t72bjwh0000gp/T/RtmpF6YsvH/file88e9178c85a1.duckdb]\n\t   i     j      x\n   <int> <int>  <dbl>\n 1    30     3  0.127\n 2    15     4  0.625\n 3     9     6  0.950\n 4    12     6 -1.89 \n 5    49     6  0.596\n 6     6     8 -3.49 \n 7    24     8 -0.476\n 8    31    10  0.227\n 9     1    13 -0.282\n10    21    13 -0.119\n# ℹ more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n⚡ > as_duckplyr_tibble(dbsm_table)\nmaterializing:\n---------------------\n--- Relation Tree ---\n---------------------\nSubquery\n\n---------------------\n-- Result Columns  --\n---------------------\n- i (INTEGER)\n- j (INTEGER)\n- x (DOUBLE)\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n\t   i     j      x\n   <int> <int>  <dbl>\n 1    30     3  0.127\n 2    15     4  0.625\n 3     9     6  0.950\n 4    12     6 -1.89 \n 5    49     6  0.596\n 6     6     8 -3.49 \n 7    24     8 -0.476\n 8    31    10  0.227\n 9     1    13 -0.282\n10    21    13 -0.119\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n\n\t\t\t- Inhering duckplyr could lead to several advantages that work with DuckDB specifically such as the `dbSpatial` package. The one downside is that we would still like to support other databses in the future.  We will perform additional testing to make sure things go smoothly (i.e. method dispatch, performance, etc.)\n\t- `dbMatrix`\n\t\t- Stabilize `Arith()` and `Ops()`\n\t\t\t- Several operations are not yet fully supported\n\t\t- Support div by 0 operations\n\t\t- Update show() functions\n\t- `dbSpatial`\n\t\t- S7 rewrite\n- dbverse preprint\n\t- More benchmarks\n\t- Practical usecase with VisiumHD\n- `GiottoDB`\n\t- WIP: drieslab/GiottoDB\n\t- Integrate dbverse objects in Giotto",
