After the talks, everyone was invited to gather in the venue for drinks and snacks. I was approached by several kind people and was overwhelmed by how many were interested in my talk. I want to again thank everyone for their interest and I hope to share more on our work very soon."

Unforutuntaly, he mentioned that there was a conflict with an R tidy event and so he would not likely be able to attend. To my surprise, I found Kirill after my talk at DuckCon! We managed to find some time to chat outside and I really enjoyed being able to discuss our projects in more detail. I thanked him for all of the incredible contributions he and his team at cynrka has made to R (i.e. maintaining the duckdb-r repo, creating duckplyr, and much more related to his work leading cynkra).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Kirill Müller (right) and I (left) sporting Posit 2024 t-shirts at DuckCon #5 in Seattle, WA with another Posit workshop instructor (center)."

    "text": "New Friends\nI’ve always wondered why academics enjoy attending conferences so much. After attending posit conference, I can now say with confidence that the best part is bumping into other people from other walks of life and learning about their unique background and shared interests. I was lucky to have such an experience when randomly meeting Jeroen Huyghe, a principal staff scientist at Fred Hutch who does some exciting research on spatial omics and cancer. Jeroen and I bonded over our shared interests in spatial omics at Posit conf and I’m very grateful to have had the opportunity to have lunch with him and learn about his experiences in the spatial omics field, working at Fred Hutch, and discussing the need for better methods for spatial omics analysis. It was a pleasure meeting you Jeroen, hope we can cross paths again in the future!"

Hope to see you again soon!\nIt was also great to see Tyrone Lee at both Posit and DuckCon. Thanks Tyrone for your encouragement ahead of my DuckCon talk and for the helpful suggestions."

I was also lucky to have sat besides Joe Chang, Hadley Wickham, and JJ Allaire at lunch!\n\n\nDuckCon\n\nHannes Mühleisen and Mark Raasveldt, Co-founders of DuckDB.\n\nI was very fortunate to meet Hannes and Mark before and after the DuckCon talks. I regret not talking more about DuckDB internals with them, but I hope to meet you again soon Hannes and Mark!\n\nJordan Tigani, CEO of MotherDuck\n\nI was lucky to have sat beside Jordan at DuckCon. I got to pitch a few ideas to Jordan about doing matrix arithmetic with Motherduck, and hear more about the recent pivot from ‘hybrid execution’ to ‘dual execution’. Shoutout to Frances Perry from Motherduck who gave a great talk, showcasing several new features with Motherduck that I’d like to soon try out.\n\nDominik Moritz, creator of Mosaic and Prof at CMU\n\nBriefly met Dominik outside of the venue, huge fan of his work and hope to soon support ways to use Mosaic with dbverse objects\n\nAnd several others…\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Obligatory DuckCon speaker dinner selfie at Tavolàta Capitol Hill.
