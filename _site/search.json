After attending posit conference, I can now say with confidence that the best part is bumping into other people from other walks of life and learning about their unique background and shared interests. I was lucky to have such an experience when randomly meeting Jeroen Huyghe, a principal staff scientist at Fred Hutch who does some exciting research on spatial omics and cancer. Jeroen and I bonded over our shared interests in spatial omics at Posit conf and Iâ€™m very grateful to have had the opportunity to have lunch with him and learn about his experiences in the spatial omics field, working at Fred Hutch, and discussing the need for better methods for spatial omics analysis. It was a pleasure meeting you Jeroen, hope we can cross paths again in the future!"

I regret not talking more about DuckDB internals with them, but I hope to meet you again soon Hannes and Mark!\n\nJordan Tigani, CEO of MotherDuck\n\nI was lucky to have sat beside Jordan at DuckCon. I got to pitch a few ideas to Jordan about doing matrix arithmetic with Motherduck, and hear more about the recent pivot from â€˜hybrid executionâ€™ to â€˜dual executionâ€™. Shoutout to Frances Perry from Motherduck who gave a great talk, showcasing several new features with Motherduck that Iâ€™d like to soon try out.\n\nDominik Moritz, creator of Mosaic and Prof at CMU\n\nBriefly met Dominik outside of the venue, huge fan of his work and hope to soon support ways to use Mosaic with dbverse objects\n\nAnd several othersâ€¦\n\n\n\n\nFigureÂ 2: Obligatory DuckCon speaker dinner selfie at TavolÃ ta Capitol Hill.

It has convenient arguments to accommodate memory limitations and other constraints that can be very useful\n\n{arrow} and {duckdb} already offer ways to do this but there are several args that {parquetize} supports that these donâ€™t\n\n\nexasol database\n\nWe did not cover this database in the workshop, but I learned about it for the first time here (even though itâ€™s been around for quite some time).\n\ncynkra/constructive\n\nKirilll used constructive::construct() to print out the contents of an R object that contained SQL. It parsed the SQL into the console nicely. I had never heard of dput before this but construct supposedly achieves similar functionality. seems handy for objects that have a lot of SQL in it.\n\nCORA dataset\n\nPublic dataset in MariaDB with plenty of examples of primary and foreign keys and good â€˜data modelingâ€™.\nThis dataset was covered as an example of how to access a DB through R/DBI with credentials.\n\nr\"()\"\n\nBeginning with R 4.0, you can use the following syntax r\"()\" to construct raw string literals, this can be handy when writing SQL as alternatives to use {glue} (one less dependency) or paste0(). You donâ€™t have to escape special characters like / or \\ which can be especially handy for writing file paths.\n\nâ€¦ much more that I do not have time to cover in this post. Check out the excellent lecture material at the link above. ## Remarks\nDespite covering a lot of material, this workshop was great. I thought it was well organized and informative. I learned a lot despite already knowing a bit about databases/R. Kirill included several visualizations of the concepts we were learning which made it easier to appreciate how they built on top of each other (one example shown below)! \nThere were several exercises that were included in the workshop that can be found on the Github repo. I thought these were quite helpful and recommend trying these out to refresh your knowledge on the many different ways to interact with databases in R. Oftentimes there are many ways to do the same thing."

So hearing that my project is of interest to others and that it could even be of use, is very encouraging.\n\n\n\nHighlight\n\nEarlier in the week at the Databases workshop at Posit conf, I invited Kirill to my DuckCon talk but he mentioned that there was a conflict with a tidy thursday event and so he would not likely be able to attend. To my surprise, I found Kirill after my talk at DuckCon! We managed to find some time to chat outside and I really enjoyed being able to discuss our projects in more detail. I made sure to shower Kirill with many thanks for all of the incredible contributions he has made for R (i.e.Â maintaining the duckdb-r repo, creating duckplyr, and much more related to his work leading cynkra).
